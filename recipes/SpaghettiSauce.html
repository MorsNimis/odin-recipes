    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a spaghetti sauce recipe I came up with 
        while living up in Northern Canada for a few months. The recipe
        does require a big time investment but it is one of my favourite dishes
        to make on the weekend and then enjoy throughout the week. For those who
        like a spicy meal this will be perfect for you!
